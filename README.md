## Setup

First of all, you need to create your own keys for using chat gpt. This can be done through their [official website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once done, create a `.env` file in the root folder and place your OpenAI keys:
````
API_KEY='your api key'
API_ORG='your organization'
````
